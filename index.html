Ok so my parents run a lawn mowing bisness and i was helping them clean
a dead persons garage, not the house only the garage and i found a old
(maybe) radio my parents let me keep it and i know how to use it and i 
thought it was like 30 - 40 years old but my grandpa said it looks 
like its 10 - 20 years old imma save this to github and in the morning
 (its 2am) imma post a picture of it if my small brained self can
 figure out how to uh yeah bye go watch a twitch stream now or
